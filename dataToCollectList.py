#Run simulation on light truck VS heavy truck

#Run simulation with two conditions for each truck type: truck fully loaded VS empty truck



#Collect the following metrics from the Model

#fuel consumed at each time the model returns the ideal target Speed

#angle value at each position the model returns the ideal target speed (to get the average fuel savings according to angle)

#ideal speed returned each time the model returned a speed

#total time to reach destination

#number of simulations run





#Collect the following metrics from SUMO in normal mode (without model instructions)

#fuel consumed at each time the model returns the ideal target Speed

#total time to reach destination

#speed at same locations as where the model gave ideal target speeds
